# Stone Game - Main Idea and Examples

## Main Idea

The Stone Game problem appears to be a complex game theory problem at first glance, but it actually has a simple mathematical solution. The key insight is:

**Alice can always win the stone game when the number of piles is even.**

This is because:
1. The total number of piles is even (given in problem constraints)
2. Alice can always choose to take either all the odd-indexed piles or all the even-indexed piles
3. One of these two groups (odd or even indexed) must sum to more than the other
4. Alice can always force Bob into the losing position by choosing the optimal strategy

Therefore, the solution can simply return `true` because Alice can always win with optimal play, regardless of the actual pile values (as long as the number of piles is even, which it always is in this problem).

## Examples

### Example 1
Input: `piles = [5,3,4,5]`
- Alice can choose either the first (5) or last pile (5)
- If she takes first 5, remaining are [3,4,5]
  - Bob takes either 3 or 5
  - Alice can then take the larger remaining pile
- If she takes last 5, similar logic applies
- Alice can always end with more stones

### Example 2
Input: `piles = [3,7,2,3]`
- Alice can choose 3 (first) or 3 (last)
- Optimal play:
  - Alice takes last 3 (piles: [3,7,2])
  - Bob takes either 3 or 2
    - If Bob takes 3, Alice takes 7
    - If Bob takes 2, Alice takes 7
- Alice wins in both scenarios

### Example 3
Input: `piles = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`
- Even with more piles, Alice can always choose a strategy to win
- She can calculate whether odd-indexed (1+3+5=9) or even-indexed (2+4+6=12) piles sum to more
- Then force Bob into the sequence where she gets the higher sum

In all cases with even number of piles, Alice can win, so the solution simply returns `true`.
